I'm currently a junior AI developer trainee @BeCode, where I am learning to develop algorithms and models that can be employed in a business environment. I'm passionate about using my skills and interests in data science and machine learning to help businesses make smarter decisions and improve their operations. I have studied Computer Science for a year at the University of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and for 2.5 years in I.T. at Alkan University College (Bahir Dar, Ethiopia). When I'm not coding, you can find me hiking, playing soccer, or watching documentaries. I love meeting new people, so feel free to say hi if you see me around!
