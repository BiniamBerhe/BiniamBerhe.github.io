This where scaling our data comes into play.Normalizing Data You can transform data for multiple features to the same scale by normalizing the data. In particular, normalization is well-suited to processing the most common data distribution, the Gaussian distributionIn general apply normalization when either of the following are true: Your data has a Gaussian distribution. Your data set lacks enough data to create quantiles.Using the Log Transform Sometimes, a data set conforms to a power law distribution that clumps data at the low end.Summary: Applay Log for data that follows power low distribution### Using Quantiles Normalization and log transforms address specific data distributions. What if data doesnâ€™t conform to a Gaussian or power-law distribution? Convert your data into quantiles by performing the following steps: Decide the number of intervals. Define intervals such that each interval has an equal number of examples. Replace each example by the index of the interval it falls in. Bring the indexes to same range as other feature data by scaling the index values to [0,1]. Resources https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/clustering/prepare-data" } ]
